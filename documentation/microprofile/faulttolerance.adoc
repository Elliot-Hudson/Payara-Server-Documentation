= Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API

_Since *4.1.2.181*; *5.181*&nbsp;_

Provided version of the API: {{ book.mpFaultToleranceSpecUrl }}[MicroProfile Fault Tolerance {{ book.mpFaultToleranceVersion }}]

== Background
The Fault Tolerance API was created to help separate execution logic from execution. 
The execution can be configured with a number of fault tolerance policies.

A full overview for the reasoning behind the API can be found in
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/blob/master/README.adoc[the
README for the source code repository.]

https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/1.0[
The complete specification] is maintained in the same repository


== Additions to the Fault Tolerance Spec
In addition to the functionality 
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-fault-tolerance-spec.asciidoc[
detailed in the spec], the following is also implemented in Payara Server and Payara Micro:

=== Configurable Managed Executor Services
The managed and scheduled managed executor pool can be configured via the _set-fault-tolerance-configuration_ asadmin command.

The managed executor service is used to execute methods annotated with @Asynchronous, whereas the managed scheduled executor 
service is used by the CircuitBreaker and Timeout interceptors for their timeout operations (scheduling the circuit breaker 
to be set to half open, and just timing out respectively).

=== Annotation Priority
The order that the fault tolerance annotations are invoked is as follows:

* Fallback (_SPECIAL CASE - you'll ONLY get here if there is an exception kicking off the asynchronous thread_)
* Asynchronous
* Fallback
* Retry
* Bulkhead
* CircuitBreaker
* Timeout

Since the asynchronous annotation is invoked first, if it's combined with any other fault tolerance annotations they will be processed on the asynchronous thread.

== Asadmin Commands

==== `set-fault-tolerance-configuration`

*Usage*::
`asadmin> set-fault-tolerance-configuration [--managedexecutorservicename=<managedexecutorservicename>] 
[--managedscheduledexecutorservicename=<managedscheduledexecutorservicename>] [--target=<server-config>]`
*Aim*::
Provides a way to set the configuration of the fault tolerance service of the targetted config.

===== Command Options
